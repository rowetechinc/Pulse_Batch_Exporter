# Pulse Batch Exporter
Export RoweTech data in a batch process.

Pulse currently requires the user to Import the data to a project.  Then export the data.  When exporting they must choose one of the formats to export to.   

This will allow the user to select multiple files.  Each file will get its own folder.  Within the folder, there will be all the exported data.  

The user can also select which ensembles and bins to export.
